                <p>I am an aspiring software engineer and interned at <a href="https://www.uptake.com/">Uptake</a> on the Application Enablement Team this past summer. I worked mostly on the metadata-driven application and also contributed to the product <a href="https://www.uptake.com/products/scout">Scout</a> through the testing and deployment process and received positive customer feedback! The summer before (2019), I interned at <a href="http://hireher.com/">Hireher LLC</a>, a small startup based in Los Angeles, CA, as a cross-team software engineer and business development intern.</p>
                <p>I've had most of my experience working with frontend technologies thus far. However, I was able to get a glimpse of the backend processes and data ingestion at my most recent internship and am very interested in gaining more experience learning about and working with backend and fullstack development.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Orange County, California and played volleyball all throughout junior high school and high school. Growing up playing multiple sports, I love being active and watching sports. In college, I am still playing competitive volleyball on the club women's volleyball team at Northwestern. I also recently started dancing, specifically hip hop and urban dance styles and am a part of Refresh Dance Crew. </p>
                <p>Random fun fact: I've completed the large minesweeper board in 90 seconds. <br> Another fun fact: I road tripped from LA to Chicago in 6 days.</p>
